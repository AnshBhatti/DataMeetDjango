# DataMeet

DataMeet uses Artificial Intelligence to allow teachers to understand if their class is confused, excited, or nervous about material being taught in class during the time of virtual learning. It uses student emotion data to assess learning and engagement during remote learning. We developed two frontend interfaces. One interface is used for taking image data from students as they engage in a videoconferencing meeting in their class, whereas the other interface is used as a data dashboard by the teacher to gain access to anonymized emotion data and gauge the overall success of learning outcomes in the class. 

Technologies:
- Frontend: ReactJS, SCSS
- Backend: Django, SQLite, Python, AWS Rekognition

Note: This repo contains only the backend code for this project.
